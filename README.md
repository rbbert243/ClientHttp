# Client Http

This assignment is for the Politehnica University of Bucharest's "Protocoale de Comunicatie" course. Users can execute different operations on a database using the project's client-server application.

## Client

CMake is used to build this project. Make sure you have CMake version 3.10 or higher installed on your system in order to create the project. then take these actions:

1. Copy the repository to your personal computer.
Go to the project directory by navigating.
3. Use'mkdir build' to create a build directory.
4. Use 'cd build' to get to the build directory.
5. Run 'cmake..' to create the build files.
6. Use the'make' command to build the project.

The 'build' directory will house the finished executable.

### Usage

To use the client, run the executable generated by the build process. The client supports the following commands:

- `register`: Register a new user account.
- `login`: Log in to an existing user account.
- `enter_library`: Enter the library system.
- `get_books`: Get a list of all books in the library.
- `get_book`: Get information about a specific book.
- `add_book`: Add a new book to the library.
- `delete_book`: Delete a book from the library.
- `logout`: Log out of the current user account.
- `help`: Display a list of available commands.
- `exit`: Exit the client.

Note that some commands require you to be logged in to a user account. If you are not logged in, you will be prompted to do so before executing the command.

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the project, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. We welcome contributions of all kinds, including bug fixes, new features, and documentation improvements.

# Code Structure

## `main.cpp`

The primary function of the client application is contained in the C++ file named `main.cpp`. The objects required to connect to the server must be created by this function, and user input must also be processed.

## `Client.cpp`

The Client class implementation is found in the source file `Client.cpp`. Establishing a connection with the server, submitting requests to the server, and getting results from the server are all tasks that belong to the Client class.

A new socket file descriptor is initialized in the`sock_fd` member variable of the `Client` class constructor, which takes a port number as an input. Additionally, it initializes the`server_addr` member variable with the servers IP address and port.

The `establish_connection`,`reconnect`,`send_request`, and `receive_response` member functions are only a few of the functions that make up the Client class. The `connect` system call is used by the `establish_connection` function to establish a connection to the server. Reconnecting with the server cuts off the existing connection and creates a new one. Using the `send` system call, the `send_request` function transmits a request to the server. The `recv` system call is used by thereceive_response function to obtain a response from the server.

## `Request.cpp`

The `Request` class implementation is found in the C++ file `Request`.cpp. The creation of HTTP requests with multiple parameters, including method, path, payload, cookie, and JWT, falls under the purview of this class. The request object is transformed into a string representation that can be delivered over the network using the classs `to_string()` method.

## `Response.cpp`

The `Response` class implementation is located in the C++ file `Response.cpp`. This class is in charge of analyzing HTTP responses that come in from a server. This class constructor breaks down a response represented as a string into its individual parts, including the HTTP version, status code, status message, headers, and body. To access these elements, the class has getter methods. An unordered map of key-value pairs serves as the storage format for the `headers` member.

## `Session.cpp`

The `Session` class implementation is found in the C++ file "`Session.cpp`". The management of the users server session falls under the purview of this class. The `client` member variable is initialized with a Client object passed as an input to the class constructor. Session class has a destructor that performs nothing.
